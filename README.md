# Explodingdog 2020
a rebuild of explodingdog.com 
fixing missing images, broken links and more from the existing site.

## explodingdog.com 
is fifteen years of drawings made in response to suggested titles. Started in January 2000

## Built with
- eleventy.js
- markdown files from last time I rebuilt the site in 2016/2017.

## why?
last time I rebuilt the site(2016/2017) I spent many hours consolidating all the drawings and their data. If I remember correctly I used a python static site generator (Pelican??) and due to poor backing up lost much of that work when I spilled coffee on my laptop.
